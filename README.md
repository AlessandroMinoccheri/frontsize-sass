###Bower install

This will download Frontsize on `bower_components` folder, you should do that from the project's root folder.

```
bower install frontsize-sass
```

---

###The next steps will be automated soon

Once you have downloaded it, copy your theme to the project front-end develop folder:

```
cp bower_components/frontsize-sass/themes/default frontsize-sass/themes/theme-name
```

Then change core references to let it point on bower folder:

So in `frontsize-sass/themes/theme-name/compile-test.scss` file:

```
@import "themes/default/config";
@import "core/core";
@import "themes/default/import";
```

Change the code to:

```
@import "themes/theme-name/config";
@import "bower_components/frontsize-sass/core/core";
@import "themes/theme-name/import";
```

The do the same in `frontsize-sass/themes/theme-name/compile.scss` file:

```
@import "core/vendor/normalize.css.scss";
@import "compile-test";
```

Change the code to:

```
@import "bower_components/frontsize-sass/core/vendor/normalize.css.scss";
@import "compile-test";
```

Now the core is easily to be upgraded with `bower update` when a new release is available.
